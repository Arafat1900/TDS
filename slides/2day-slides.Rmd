# Set-up

--

## Effective use of R/RStudio

---

# Using packages: example with sf/ggplot2

- See Efficient R Programming, Section [4.4](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html#package-selection), and R4DS, Chapter [2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)

```{r, out.width="30%", fig.show='hold', message=FALSE}
d = data.frame(x = 1:9, y = (1:9)^2)
plot(d)           # base R
library(ggplot2)  # with a package
ggplot(d) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y))
```

## What is transport data science?

- The application of data science to transport datasets and problems

--

- Raising the question...

--

- What is data science?

<!-- You tell me! -->

--

- A discipline "that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge" `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

--

In other words...

- Statistics that is actually useful!

---

## A geographic perspective

- See https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/blob/master/catalogue.md

- Paper on the **stplanr** paper for transport planning (available [online](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/stplanr-paper.html)) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_stplanr_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
- Introductory and advanced content on geographic data in R, especially the [transport chapter](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) (available free [online](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)) `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` 
- Paper on analysing OSM data in Python `r Citep(my_bib, "boeing_osmnx_2017", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))` (available [online](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01890)) 

```{r geocompr-cover, echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/images/cover.png")
```

---


## Data science and the tidyverse

- Inspired by Introduction to data science with R (available free [online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) `r Citep(my_bib, "grolemund_r_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`


```{r tds-cover, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b88ef926a004b0fce72b2526b0b5c4413666a4cb/24a30/cover.png")
```

---

## Transport software options

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
file.copy("../transport-software.csv", ".")
tms = readr::read_csv("transport-software.csv")[1:5]
tms = dplyr::arrange(tms, dplyr::desc(Citations))
knitr::kable(tms, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Sample of transport modelling software in use by practitioners. Note: citation counts based on searches for company/developer name, the product name and 'transport'. Data source: Google Scholar searches, October 2018.", format = "html")
```

# Getting help online

- [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions) has 21,314 questions 

- [r-sig-geo](http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/) has 1000s of posts

- RStudio's Discourse community has 65,000+ posts already!

--

- No transport equivalent (e.g. earthscience.stackexchange.com is in beta)

- Potential for a Discourse forum or similar: transport is not (just) GIS

---

## How is data science used in the PCT?

- It's all reproducible, e.g.:
- Find short in which more people drive than cycle

--

- Stage 1: get data from web

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: get top 1000 lines in repo
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "isle-of-wight")
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(1000, all)
write_sf(desire_lines, "desire_lines.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("desire_lines.geojson")
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
# Set-up, after installing pct and checking out www.pct.bike:
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "isle-of-wight") %>% 
  top_n(n = 1000, wt = all)
```

---

## Stage II: Geographic data analysis

- Interested only in top 200 lines

```{r}
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(n = 20, wt = all)
```


---

## Stage III: Visualising (polution) data

<!-- A fundamental part of data science is being able to understand your data. -->

<!-- That requires visualisation, R is great for that: -->

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
.pull-left[
plot(desire_lines)
]
.pull-right[
]
```


<!-- - Interactively: -->

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines("bicycle", lwd = "all", scale = 5) +
  tm_basemap(server = leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite)
```


---

## Stage IV: Origin-destination data analysis

- Now we have data in our computer, and verified it works, we can use it

- Which places are most car dependent? 

```{r}
car_dependent_routes = desire_lines %>% 
  mutate(percent_drive = car_driver / all * 100) %>% 
  filter(rf_dist_km < 3 & rf_dist_km > 1) 
```

- Get routes

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
routes = stplanr::line2route(car_dependent_routes)
car_dependent_routes$geometry = routes$geometry
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# sf::write_sf(car_dependent_routes, "car_dependent_routes.geojson")
# piggyback::pb_upload("car_dependent_routes.geojson")
# piggyback::pb_download_url("car_dependent_routes.geojson")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# car_dependent_routes = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.2/car_dependent_routes.geojson")
```

---

## Communicating results

Visualisation is vital

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
b = c(0, 25, 50, 75)
tm_shape(car_dependent_routes) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5, breaks = b, palette = "-inferno")
```

# Recap

1. Practice subsetting techniques you have learned on the `sf data.frame` object `iow`:
     1. Create an object called `iow_small` which contains only regions with less than 3000 people in the `all` column
     1. Create a selection object called `sel_high_car` which is `TRUE` for regions with above median numbers of people who travel by car and `FALSE` otherwise
     1. How many regions have the number '1' in the column 'geo_name'? What percentage of the regions in the Isle of Wight is this?
     1. Create an object called `iow_foot` which contains only the foot attribute from `iow`
     1. Bonus: plot the result to show where walking is a popular mode of travel to work
     1. Bonus: bulding on your answers to previous questions, use `filter()` from the `dplyr` package to subset small regions where high car use is high
1. Bonus: What is the population density of each region (hint: you may need to use the functions `st_area()`, `as.numeric()` and use the 'all' column)?
1. Bonus: Which zone has the highest percentage who cycle?
1. Bonus: Find the proportion of people who drive to work (`car_driver`) in areas in which more than 500 people walk to work

# stats19 data analysis 

- See [itsleeds.github.io/stats19](https://itsleeds.github.io/stats19/)

--

Basics of STATS19 data

- Spatial *and* temporal attributes allow subsetting
- Spatial resolution: ~10 metres
- Temporal resolution: ~10 minutes

---

## stats19 exercises 

1. Download and plot all crashes reported in Great Britain in 2017 (hint: see [the stats19 vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stats19/vignettes/stats19.html))
1. Find the function in the `stats19` package that converts a `data.frame` object into an `sf` data frame. Use this function to convert the road crashes into an `sf` object, called `crashes_sf`, for example.
1. Filter crashes that happened in the Isle of Wight based on attribute data (hint: the relevant column contains the word `local`)
1. Filter crashes happened in the Isle of Wight using geographic subsetting (hint: remember `st_crs()`?)
1. Bonus: Which type of subsetting yielded more results and why? 
1. Bonus: how many crashes happened in each zone?
1. Create a new column called `month` in the crash data using the function `lubridate::month()` and the `date` column.
1. Create an object called `a_iow_may` representing all the crashes that happened in the Isle of Wight in the month of May
1. Bonus: Calculate the average (`mean`) speed limit associated with each crash that happened in May across the zones of the Isle of Wight (the result is shown in the map)

---

## Speed crashes in the IoW in May

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(stats19)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
a = get_stats19(2017, "ac", ask = FALSE)
asf = format_sf(a)
a_iow = asf %>% 
  filter(local_authority_district == "Isle of Wight")
nrow(a_iow)
iow = pct::get_pct_zones(region = "isle-of-wight")
iow_osbg = st_transform(iow, 27700)
a_iow_sf = a_iow[iow_osbg, ]
nrow(a_iow_sf)
# mapview::mapview(iow) +
#   mapview::mapview(a_iow)
class(a$date)
class(a$time)
a_iow$month = lubridate::month(a_iow$date)
a_iow_may = a_iow %>% 
  filter(month == 5)
a_agg = aggregate(a_iow_may["speed_limit"], iow_osbg, mean)
plot(a_agg)
```
