<!-- # Introduction -->

<!-- Welcome to Transport Data Science.  -->
<!-- Please make sure to read everything here in detail before the class begins. -->

## Module description

The quantity, diversity and availability of transport data is increasing rapidly, requiring new skills in the transport sector.

Recent years have seen a new wave of big data, data science, and smart
cities changing the world, with the Harvard Business Review describing Data
Science as the sexiest job of the 21st century. Transport researchers need to
be able to use data (and databases) in order to establish quantitative, empirical
facts, and to validate/challenge their mathematical models. This module takes
a highly practical approach to learning about `data science' tools and their
application to investigating transport issues. The focus is on team work with
real data and tools rather than theory.
Students should become condent to enter a team-based data science con-
sulting environment, selecting appropriate tools to set up and solve business
questions using data. Such projects typically include:
â€¢ Finding the right question to ask, including ethical issues
â€¢ Obtaining the right data
â€¢ Data cleaning
â€¢ Conceptual database design
1â€¢ Computational database issues, include big data systems
â€¢ Statistics and machine learning analytics
â€¢ Visualization and presentation
â€¢ Appreciate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied
to transport problems, compared with other types of modeling and fore-
casting.
Some of the topics we will cover are:
â€¢ Practical database manipulation with SQL
â€¢ Classical relational database design
â€¢ Data for transport
â€¢ Data scraping from semi-structured web sources
â€¢ Machine learning tools Bayesian networks
â€¢ Ontological issues in database design
â€¢ Beyond SQL  the big data revolution and the Hadoop stack
â€¢ Data visualization
â€¢ Professional and ethical issues of big data in transport
â€¢ Transport data analysis mini-project will be integrated throughout the
module.
Some of the skills you will learn include:
â€¢
What is a relational database and in which circumstances is it a useful
tool
â€¢ How to design and create a relational database to house `raw' data
â€¢ How to interrogate such data using SQL and hence provide appropriate
data for transport modeling
â€¢
How machine learning and other tools can provide understanding of the
data and its structure.
â€¢
How to visualize the data stored in a database.
General skills for life we will develop include:
â€¢ Analytic skills
â€¢ Creative problem solving
â€¢ Critical thinking
â€¢ Research skills
â€¢ Team working

Team-working
You are from a range of backgrounds and dierent parts of the module will be
easy for people with particular backgrounds such as computer programming,
system administration, statistics, and transport applications. You are supposed
to work closely together on everything except the text of your written reports.
I expect that you to share your existing skills and knowledge with the rest of
the team.
Examination of this module is not competitive and everyone will
score highly if you all help each other. I would like the whole team to do great
work together and all get distinctions for it.
You are reminded of the Leeds
sta-student charter which includes agreements for all sta and students to be
professional, courteous, and helpful to one another at all times. A signicant
part of your learning should come from the experiences of the other students
and you need to work together to enable this.
46
Class rules
â€¢ The class schedule is available on the central ITS timetable webpage.
â€¢ Handouts and other materials will be put on VLE/Blackboard at vlebb.leeds.ac.uk
â€¢ Session format will vary but will typically include 1 hour presentation and
discussion of new topics, then an hour of project work where I am available
to help with practical work.
â€¢
I expect you to deliver week N's assigned work at least a day before week
N+1's meeting if you would like me to read it.
â€¢
MOST OF THE WORK FOR THIS MODULE WILL BE DONE
OUTSIDE CLASS. We will meet weekly to introduce new topics and to
discuss what we have been doing during the week, but the real work comes
from doing project work and reading both recommended papers and your
own explorations of the literature for the rest of the week. You will not
get a DISTINCTION just by sitting in the class sessions. The purpose of
the class sessions is to guide your real work during the week.
â€¢
YOU ARE EXPECTED TO ASK QUESTIONS AND ARGUE.
Unlike some countries, teachers in the UK do not assume they are always
right or that you must believe everything they say. I want you to debate
the ideas, this is a very new and fast-moving subject and I do not know all
the answers myself. If you think I am wrong or have missing something
then put up your hand and start an argument about it! I enjoy learning
new ideas from you students if you have done your own reading and want
to discuss it in class or use it to argue against me.
If you start a good
argument and write it up in your report then we will give you credit for it.
Please do not just sit and listen - you can do that for free on the Internet.
Instead use it to interact. However  debate should be polite, and based
on solid citable facts; also please respect the time of the other students
and ensure that everyone gets to take part.
I will ask speakers to stop
if they are taking up more than 1/S of the classes time where S is the
number of students.
â€¢
Please email me if you are stuck or have questions or interesting ideas
you would like to share: C.W.Fox@leeds.ac.uk. Please include the course
number in the subject line as I may be teaching more than one class. I
can also be found eating lunch in the ITS Foyer during some lunchtimes,
or knock on the door of my oce Room 2.04. I am usually available to
help with problems - however I expect that before asking for help you will
(1) ask the rest of your team for help; (2) search the Internet for technical
problems; (3) mention who you have asked and paste what you have found
on the net in your email to me to show that you have done 1 and 2. Please
do not waste my time asking questions that are already on the Internet
as it will reduce the time I can spend helping others with more dicult
5questions. If you spend a lot of time xing a problem yourself, make sure
to write about it in your report so that we can give you credit for it, I
know it can be hard work.
â€¢
For international students: My full name is Dr Charles Fox. Charles
is my personal name, Fox is my family name. Please call me Charles.
This is informal. Dr Fox is used only in formal situations (usually when
I am asking people for money) not in Leeds classes.
If you are from a
country where the name you use in class is not the same as the rst one
written down (eg. if you write your family name rst), then please tell me
and the rest of the class so we know what to call you.
â€¢
I am happy to be your friend on Linked-In or Diaspora and to write job
references for you. If you are interested in doing a PhD or industry work
in this eld then please ask me about it.

Credit assignment
This is a 15 credit module.
7.1 Examination method
This is not a traditional lecture course. I do not expect you to memorize in-
formation or copy it out in exams. Instead, the module is 100% examined by
your individual written reports on a single real-life team project, which will run
throughout the module. The purpose of all the readings, talking, and exercises
I will give you is just to help you build the skills and ideas needed to deliver this
project and report. The whole class will work together as one team to deliver
a real project for a real-life transportation partner, external to the university.
The resulting system may be used to manage real trac in the UK. It is unusual
to trust MSc module students with critical work such as this - we are putting
ITS and Leeds reputation on the line by showing our students to the world like
this. But we aim to be the top transport maths MSc in the world so we want
to do things that other universities cannot do!
I want you to enjoy doing data science for real, it can be a lot of fun to make
your own systems and analyses, and many people do it as a leisure activity and
post their work on beautiful blogs such as http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/
. Project report marking is designed to encourage this.
To achieve a PASS in this module, your report must:
â€¢
Include text or results which demonstrate a basic understanding of the
ideas from every session's handout. For example, if you are not very inter-
ested in the ethics session and want to spend your time hacking Python,
then could just include one short page summarizing the key points from
the ethics session in the context of your work in the project.
To achieve a DISTINCTION in this module, your report must:
6â€¢
Include text or results which demonstrate a basic understanding of the
ideas from every session's handout and signicantly go beyond the ma-
terial presented in the module from at least one session. You don't need
to become an expert in every part of the module, but you are strongly
encouraged to discover what interests and excites you and to ex-
plore it in detail by yourself. A Masters degree is the highest type of
taught degree as should prepare you to do your own research in the future,
where there will not be anyone to tell you what to do any more. I want
to reward you for doing this. DISTINCTION will mention material from
all sessions as in a PASS report, but then build on one or more of them.
This will include citing references to papers and books that have not been
specically recommended in the handouts, and/or building software be-
yond what has been taught in class. You cannot get a distinction just
by learning what is taught in the handouts , you must demonstrate
some ability to use libraries and research papers and to do your own work
because that is what makes you a Master of your subject.
The content of each handout will have equal weight in the marking. The best
way to manage your work is to demonstrate basic understandings of most of the
modules, then nd one or more areas that you love and do something exciting
and new in them.
The project is designed to incorporate all the topics that will be discussed
in the sessions and handouts, but also to provide scope for students to focus on
particular topics of personal interest to get DISTINCTIONs. You will need to
work very closely as a team, both to deliver the work and to agree on who will
do what. For example, we expect that students from a computing background
will choose to specialize in the details of database or web server installations,
while those from geography backgrounds will specialize in the design of the
application and consulting on client requirements.
While the project itself runs as a team, examination is strictly per-person.
You will each write one report which both summarizes the whole project, with
one chapter per session handout, making reference to its key points, but also
showing o your particular contributions in more detail. If you can show some
good work of your own, and relate it to research papers that you have found
yourself, then we will award a distinction. I understand that programming work
is time consuming and that a short piece of text describing an amazing piece of
code is worth a lot more than a long piece of text which does not describe any
code.
Grades will be awarded by an independent ITS examiner, taking recom-
mendations from myself and from the external partner into account. We may
perform verbal examinations to gather additional information as well as reading
the written report - typically to verify that the text in your report is your own
work.
You are strongly encouraged to work together to discuss topics, structures
and content for your reports, and to help one another. We want everyone to
get a DISTINCTION, it's not a competition. Figures and results can be shared
7between reports but all text must be written individually and declared
so by the author . Any direct text plagiarism will result in a FAIL result of
the module. Data science software will be used to detect plagiarism !
The project will be conducted with and for an external UK transport part-
ner, and maybe include a visits to and from their site. We are putting Leeds
reputation into the project so please behave professionally at all times, espe-
cially when working with external partners, which should be treated similarly
to a job interview. External partners often recruit students from projects after
their courses, and indeed this can be a major reason for them agreeing to help
with the projects.
7.2 Marking scheme objectives
The purpose of our marking scheme recommendation is to encourage students
to learn enough Data Science to be both:
â€¢ immediately useful in industry with current tools and concepts
â€¢ theoretically competent to adapt to changes in tools and concepts during
your career
The reason that we study general concepts as well as specic tools (eg Python
libraries) is to enable the second of these. This is what makes an academic uni-
versity course dierent from, and better than, most teach yourself programming
in 24 hours types books and on-line courses.
Working data scientists rarely work alone, and usually work together in
teams which include clients, colleges, managers and sta. Being able to do this
is an essential part of the eld and should be experienced and demonstrated in
this module.
As team members, Data Scientists will often specialize in some aspect of the
eld, whilst knowing enough overview of other areas needed to communicate
with other team members.
This type is skill set is sometimes call T shaped
people where the shape of the letter T indicates general breath and specialist
depth. The marking scheme should reect and encourage this. Team member-
ship is dened by the module manager, i.e. students are put into teams as in
the real world.
Fundamentally, the purpose of the marking scheme is to indicate to future
high-quality employers:
â€¢
PASS: The University of Leeds states, putting its reputation and brand
at stake as proof, that the student has a working knowledge of the items in
the module syllabus objectives, sucient to join a high-quality operational
transport data science team. The University of Leeds recommends that
you hire the student.
â€¢
DISTINCTION: The University of Leeds states, putting its reputation
and brand at stake as proof, that the student has the above and also
has some practical, research, theoretical and/or management skills over
8and beyond it, suitable to lead some aspect of a high-quality data sci-
ence team's work. The University of Leeds recommends that you hire the
student at a higher pay grade with leadership responsibilities.
â€¢
FAIL: The University of Leeds is not willing to stake its reputation and
brand on recommending the student to join a high-quality data science
team.
7.3 Implementation
The recommended marking scheme below reects the content and balance of
the module objectives as in the course handbook.
Rather than a written examination, the module is assessed solely on individ-
ual written reports describing a group project and its connections to the theory
presented in the module handouts.
This is designed to give opportunities to
specialize, work as a team, experience practical development work, and demon-
strate understanding of the underlying concepts. A good way to demonstrate
theoretical understanding is to describe the links between your implementations
to the theory  this also prevents internet plagiarism because your implementa-
tions are unique to your team's task and data.
Leeds modules are not allowed to award marks non-linearly, but we have
achieved a similar goal by linearizing a set of non-linear, roughly sigmoidal,
eort functions for dierent topics. This is designed to maximally reward T
shaped work.
â€¢
To PASS you must show a general/broad understanding of each section of
the module. This corresponds to the broad generalist, top line of the T.
â€¢
To get DISTINCTION you must PASS and also show either (a) major per-
sonal contributions to the practical systems produced by the team and/or
(b) major understanding of theoretical concepts (including management
or teaching concepts) from the literature not taught in class. This corre-
sponds to the deep specialist, bottom line of the T.
The module leader does not award marks, though may recommend them as
a rst marker. Formal awards are made only by a second marker examiner,
using the module objectives listed in the syllabus to grade.
For each objective, the rst three recommended marks are for general knowl-
edge of the topic, the remaining two are for leadership activity.

Recommended marking scheme
One mark per bullet point below (35 in total). You are strongly recommended
to refer to these points in your written reports.
For example, you may use
marginal notes to show where each mark is being claimed in the text; or embed
the mark numbers into the text like citations; or structure your report under
mark names as headings. You may refer to the marks by the numbers below,
9for example Mark 5.3.2. This will make it easier for the assessors to give you
all the relevant credit that you deserve.
8.1 Understand the concepts of classical database design,
and problems and limitations.
1. Describe your team's database design
2. Discuss limitations of your team's database design, such as big data
scaling issues.

5. Describe your own this code uses concepts from the literature not taught
in class
8.2 Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport
related data.
1. Describe how your team obtained and cleaned data
2. Describe how your team stored and transported data
3. Discuss the theoretical concepts underlying what you or your team have
done. Make links between specic concepts and specic implementations.
4. Describe your own personal contribution to this code
5. Describe how your own work uses concepts from the literature not taught
in class

for database operation.
1. Show examples of your team's SQL commands
2. Describe what they do and how they were written
3. Describe what happens inside your database to execute this code, includ-
ing discussion of eects of optimizations you have made
4. Describe your own personal contribution to this code
5. Describe how your own work uses concepts from the literature not taught
in class
108.4 Experience basic machine learning / data mining tools
1. Show example results of your team's machine learning / data mining sys-
tems
2. Show the code used to generate them and describe what it does
3. Describe the underlying theory behind them and contrast it with alterna-
tive approaches
4. Describe your own personal contribution to this code
5. Describe how your own work uses concepts from the literature not taught
in class
8.5 Produce data visualizations
1. Show examples of your team's results
2. Describe how they were produced
3. Describe the theory about why they were designed this way
4. Describe your own personal contribution to this code
5. Describe how your own work uses concepts from the literature not taught
in class
8.6 Understand `big data' tools and concepts, the need
for them, and how they dier from classical databases
1. Show examples of your team's big data systems
2. Describe how they were produced
3. Describe the theory about why they were designed this way
4. Describe your own personal contribution to this code
5. Describe how your own work uses concepts from the literature not taught
in class
8.7 Learn how to set up and solve transport problems in
teams
1. Show examples of your team's work as teamwork , i.e.
how work was
divided, scheduled, and managed by the team.
2. Give examples of how you communicated your own ideas and design to
the rest of the team, including evidence that they understood the commu-
nication.
113. Describe any management, professional, and ethical frameworks used in
the decisions
4. Describe your own personal contribution to team management, including
coaching other team members
5. Describe your own use of innovative management not taught in class (e.g.
use of formal project management or teaching techniques)
8.8 Grading recommendations
â€¢ One mark per bullet point above (total=35)
â€¢ 18/35 (51%) marks needed to PASS, 25/35 (71%) for DISTINCTION
Note that it is possible, though dicult, to obtain DISTINCTION without writ-
ing any code. For example, this could be done by acting as project manager,
using innovative management techniques, becoming a QGIS expert, and/or pro-
viding signicant novel ideas to project by researching them from literature not
taught in class. The student would still need to understand the team's code and
be able to explain what it does, linking the algorithmic level to code fragments.
This scenario is intentional because the module is not a programming class, and
it seeks to replicate a real Data Science environment. There are a few real world
Data Scientists who do not write code. However the scheme is also designed to
prevent PASS without working through the team, so if these innovative ideas
are not implemented by others in the team then they are unlikely to help score
any credit for anyone. As a manager or theoretician, your specialist skills in-
clude being able to persuade others to implement your ideas, and the scheme is
designed to reect this.

ITS/Leeds standard processes
Coursework submission.
All coursework should be submitted using the
coursework coversheet found in the coursework submission area on the VLE.
You should not put your name on your coursework so that it can be marked
electronically, however, you should put your ID number in the header in the top
right hand corner of every page after the title page, and the module number
in the top left hand corner of every page after the title page. The spreadsheet
part of the coursework will be submitted electronically via the VLE using your
student ID number in the lename. All coursework should be submitted elec-
tronically through turnitin on the VLE by the 2pm on the day of the deadline.
Each assignment will have its own electronic submission pigeonhole in which you
can upload your work. Please note that in the case of group work all members
are equally responsible for the submission of coursework by any one member. It
is your responsibility to make sure you are aware of the deadline for each piece
of work. Late submission will lead to the imposition of the normal University
penalties; 5 marks are deducted for a submission that is made after the 2pm
12deadline on day one, and any time until 2pm on day 2.
Thereafter students
lose a further 5 marks for each subsequent period of 24 hours.
The time on
the turnitin receipt for coursework is denitive in terms of monitoring late sub-
missions. It is your responsibility to make sure that you have allowed enough
time to submit your work and that you have a receipt. If your receipt does not
appear in your inbox straightaway you can go back to the submission area and
request a receipt in order to have conrmation that you have submitted your
work successfully.
Students with dyslexia Students with dyslexia should request a dyslexia
coversheet be attached to their work when handing coursework in to the oce.
A soft copy of the dyslexia coversheet is also available online for you to include
it in the softcopy of your work when submitting to the VLE.
Coursework Extension Requests Note: Extensions are only granted in
cases were a student has experienced serious diculty which has prevented the
completion of work within the normal time period. This may be due to illness,
bereavement, family problems or similar.
They are not granted for minor or
short term problems, including IT issues
Should you have any mitigating circumstances which lead to you wanting to
request an extension to your coursework deadline, or prevent you from attending
an examination please contact ITS Student Education Service Oce before the
day of the deadline or examination.
Mitigating circumstances are signicantly disruptive or unexpected events
which are beyond your control but which might aect your academic perfor-
mance. If this applies, you should inform your parent school as soon as possible.
Late Submission Penalties : 5 marks are deducted for a submission that
is made after the deadline (2 pm) on day 1 and any time until 2 pm on day
2.
Thereafter students lose a further 5 marks for each subsequent period of
24 hours (assuming the work is marked out of 90 or 100 on the University's
standard 20-90 or 0-100 scale). If your assessed work is over 14 days late, you
will receive a mark of 20 on the 20-90 scale or a mark of 0 on the 0-100 scale.
Plagiarism. Please make sure that you know what constitutes as plagia-
rism.
The University denes plagiarism as presenting someone else's work as
your own, including images and other material as well as text. Do not plagia-
rise, collude, or cheat in any way.
All instances of plagiarism will be treated
severely according to University disciplinary procedures. If you are unsure, check
the University Library's plagiarism web pages: http://library.leeds.ac.uk/skills-
plagiarism
Referencing . Referencing is the acknowledgment of the sources you used
when producing your piece of work.
Referencing correctly is important to
demonstrate how widely you have researched your subject, to show the basis of
your arguments and conclusions, and to avoid plagiarism. You need to give the
person reading your assignment enough information to nd the sources you have
consulted. This is done by including citations in your work and providing a list
of references.
You are expected to use the University's version of the Harvard
referencing style for your assignments for this module. Guidance on how to in-
clude citations within your text and how to reference dierent types of material
13using Harvard is provided here: http://library.leeds.ac.uk/skills-referencing.
Reading Materials You are encouraged to read widely and engage with
the peer-reviewed academic journal articles. Reading lists are not exhaustive:
just because a paper is not mentioned on the reading list does not mean that it
is not worthwhile. You are expected to conduct your own searches for relevant
journal articles.
Skills@Library Skills@Library is available to all students and can help
develop a wide range of academic skills and strategies.
There are workshops
available in the Laidlaw Library on lots of dierent topics, including planning
your essay or dissertation, writing academically and presentation skills. For 1-
to-1 support on academic study skills you can talk to a Learning Advisor who
can help you with developing a wide range of academic skills and strategies on
topics including academic writing, critical thinking, researching and maths. The
Skills@Library website has lots of online help and information on study skills,
referencing and how to tackle dierent types of assignments, as well revision and
exam tips. You can also book workshops and one to one appointments through
the website: https://library.leeds.ac.uk/skills

Feedback
Only your nal report is assessed formally as part of your MSc grade. However
very strongly recommend that you make some notes each week on the topics
presented, which I am able to read and give feedback on. You will probably want
to update and paste these notes together to form parts of your nal report. I
expect that reports will at least PASS if they have all received and acted on
feedback from each session.
We will discuss your project work each week which will include me giving
feedback on progress. You are encouraged to give each other feedback as you
work together.
Please provide feedback to me on my teaching in the following ways:
â€¢ Formally, by completing a module evaluation at the end
â€¢ Informally, by talking to me in and after class. Please come and talk
to me and let me know how I am doing and if there are things we
can improve about the course presentation as we go along. As this is a
small class I am able to adjust the presentation to meet your personal
requirements to some extent. I want you to learn as much as possible and
enjoy the subject so if you have ideas for how we can do this better then
I really, really want to know! If my teaching is not working for you then
LET ME KNOW so we can x it.
We are professionals and we do not
feel embarrassed if you say our teaching is not working for you. We do
not care about saving face here.
Please do not sit in silence or respect
