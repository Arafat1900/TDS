<!-- # Introduction -->

<!-- Welcome to Transport Data Science.  -->
<!-- Please make sure to read everything here in detail before the class begins. -->

# Module description


The quantity, diversity and availability of transport data is increasing rapidly, requiring skills in the management and interrogation of data and databases.
Recent years have seen a new wave of 'big data' and 'data science' changing the world, with the Harvard Business Review describing Data Science as the 'sexiest job of the 21st century' (see [hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)).
Transport researchers increasingly need to take data from a wide range of sources and perform non-standard analyses methods on them to inform the decision-making process.

Despite these developments the transport sector has been slow to adapt to new methods and workflows.
The Transport Systems Catapult, for example, identified a skills gap in "skilled technical talent capable of handling and analysing very large datasets compiled from multiple sources" (see [ts.catapult.org.uk](https://ts.catapult.org.uk/news-events-gallery/news/report-warns-of-uk-skills-shortage-in-im-sector/)).

This module takes a highly practical approach to learning about 'data science' tools and their application to investigating transport issues.
The focus is on practical data science, enabling attendees to make use of a wide range of datasets to answer real-world transport planning questions.
The course objectives are to:

- Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic.
- Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data.
- Gain proficiency in command-line tools for handling large transport datasets.
- Learn machine learning and data modelling techniques
- Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
- Learn where to find large transport datasets and assess data quality
- Learn how to join together the components of transport data science into a cohesive project portfolio 

<!-- Such projects typically include: -->
<!-- - Finding the right question to ask, including ethical issues -->
<!-- - Obtaining the right data -->
<!-- - Data cleaning -->
<!-- - Conceptual database design -->
<!-- 1- Computational database issues, include big data systems -->
<!-- - Statistics and machine learning analytics -->
<!-- - Visualization and presentation -->
<!-- - Appreciate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied -->
<!-- to transport problems, compared with other types of modeling and fore- -->

# Team working

Although individual reports will be submitted, you are encouraged to collaborate throughout the course.
Group projects that are based on a single topic or dataset, but with each member focussing on a different aspect for the report, are allowed.

# Course information

- The class schedule is available on the central ITS timetable webpage.
- Session format will vary but will typically include a presentation and discussion of new topics, then project work where the lecturer is available to help with practical work.
- Much of the work contributing to the final report will be done outside class hours

Questions are encouraged so please just ask if you have any doubts.
It may also help if you:

1. ask course colleagues for help
2. search the Internet for technical problems before asking
3. create a reproducible example to highlight the question in code
4. mention who you have asked and paste what you have found on the net in your email to me to show that you have done 1 and 2.

# Credit assignment

This is a 15 credit module.

## Examination method

This is not a traditional lecture course.
The module is 100% examined by a report on a single team project.
The coursework can be a **maximum** of **15 pages** long and **3000 words** in total, excluding references.
Quality is valued over quantity.

The coursework is a 'portfolio' of work that you will build-up over the course of the project.
**It will be submitted on the Friday of week 24**, the first week of May.

The purpose of all the readings, talking, and exercises is to help you build the skills and ideas needed to deliver this project and report.
<!-- The class will work together as one team to deliver results. -->
Reports receiving a high grade will cite references to academic papers and other resources used in the work.
They can include resources in the taught material or resources that go beyond what has been taught in class.

## Marking scheme

To achieve a PASS, the report must demonstrate an understanding of the techniques covered in the practical sessions, with reference to concepts underlying Data Science, taught in the lectures.
At least two outputs (images, tables, model results) must be presented to demonstrate the results of your work.
There will be a basic explanation of the underlying code.
To achieve a DISTINCTION the report must include text that shows understanding that goes beyond the material presented in the module from at least one session.

High marks will be awarded to reports that show awareness of skills useful in industry and the ability to use theoretical concepts to inform the work.
Data scientists rarely work alone so marks will also be awarded for evidence of collaboration, e.g. the adaptation of someone else's (or some organisation's) code/method with full credit to the original.

<!-- The module leader does not award marks, though may recommend them as a first marker. -->
<!-- The final awards are made by a second marker examiner. -->
Marks are awarded in 5 categories, each of which is evaluated out of 20 and which will take account of the following criteria:

**Understanding of concepts, methods and approaches**

1. Demonstrate understanding of core concepts of data science, including data cleaning/wrangling, joining, exploratory analysis and visualisation.
1. Implement methods appropriate to the objectives of the report.
1. Discuss alternative methods/approaches that could have been used, and consider and their advantages and disadvantages.
1. Describe code that you have written as part of the analysis.

    **Data, processing access and cleaning**

1. Describe how your team obtained and cleaned data
1. Describe methods for cleaning the data and how this added value to it
1. Discuss methods for gaining data using transport techniques such as routing and conversion of origin-destination data to geographic desire lines
2. Describe how your team stored and transported data, including appropriate file formats

    **Application choice and machine learning**

1. Choice of topic that has interesting datasets and important real world applications
1. Appropriate use of methods for the choice of application
1. Demonstrate the progression from a simplistic model of the data to machine learning techniques
3. Discuss alternative approaches

    **Visualization**

1. Include high quality, attractive and innovative visualisations
2. Describe how they were produced, including code
3. Describe the theory about why they were designed this way
5. Describe how your own work uses concepts from the literature

    **Understand the data science process**

1. The results presented are reproducible using code shared in the report submission or on a code-sharing platform.
1. Evaluation of the computational efficiency of the approach taken and discuss how scalable the code used is and changes that could be made to make it work on larger datasets, e.g. with reference to a benchmark to test different methods/implementations.
1. Provide evidence of teamwork, e.g. how work was divided, scheduled, and managed.
2. Give examples of how you communicated your own ideas to the target audience of the report and within the group.

# ITS/Leeds standard processes

**Coursework submission**:

All coursework should be submitted via the VLE.
Do not put your name on your coursework but do put your ID number and module number on the front cover.

All coursework should be submitted electronically through turnitin on the VLE by the 2pm on the day of the deadline.
5 marks are deducted for a submission that is made after the 2pm deadline on day one, and any time until 2pm on day 2.
Thereafter students lose a further 5 marks for each subsequent period of 24 hours.
If your assessed work is over 14 days late, you
will receive a mark of 20 on the 20-90 scale or a mark of 0 on the 0-100 scale.

It is your responsibility to make sure that you have allowed enough time to submit your work and that you have a receipt.
If your receipt does not appear in your inbox straightaway you can go back to the submission area and request a receipt in order to have confirmation that you have submitted your work successfully.

Students with dyslexia Students with dyslexia should request a dyslexia coversheet be attached to their work when handing coursework.
Coursework Extension Requests Note: Extensions are only granted in
cases were a student has experienced serious difficulty which has prevented the
completion of work within the normal time period. This may be due to illness,
bereavement, family problems or similar.
They are not granted for minor or
short term problems, including IT issues
Should you have any mitigating circumstances which lead to you wanting to
request an extension to your coursework deadline, or prevent you from attending
an examination please contact ITS Student Education Service Oce before the
day of the deadline or examination.
Mitigating circumstances are significantly disruptive or unexpected events
which are beyond your control but which might affect your academic performance. If this applies, you should inform your parent school as soon as possible.

**Plagiarism.** Please make sure that you know what constitutes as plagiarism.
The University defines plagiarism as presenting someone else's work as
your own, including images and other material as well as text. Do not plagiarise, collude, or cheat in any way.
All instances of plagiarism will be treated
severely according to University disciplinary procedures. If you are unsure, check
the University Library's plagiarism web pages: http://library.leeds.ac.uk/skills-plagiarism

**Referencing.** Referencing is the acknowledgment of the sources you used when producing your piece of work.
Referencing correctly is important to demonstrate how widely you have researched your subject, to show the basis of your arguments and conclusions, and to avoid plagiarism.
You need to give the person reading your assignment enough information to nd the sources you have consulted.
This is done by including citations in your work and providing a list
of references.
You are expected to use the University's version of the Harvard referencing style for your assignments for this module.
Guidance on how to include citations within your text and how to reference die rent types of material using Harvard is provided here: http://library.leeds.ac.uk/skills-referencing. 

I personally recommend using Zotero, a free and open source reference management system.
Used in sync with writing software such as RStudio with the **citr** package installed can make referencing fun!

**Reading Materials.**
You are encouraged to read widely and engage with
the peer-reviewed academic journal articles. Reading lists are not exhaustive:
just because a paper is not mentioned on the reading list does not mean that it
is not worthwhile. You are expected to conduct your own searches for relevant
journal articles.

Library Skills is available to all students and can help
develop a wide range of academic skills and strategies.
There are workshops
available in the Laidlaw Library on lots of die rent topics, including planning
your essay or dissertation, writing academically and presentation skills. For 1-to-1 support on academic study skills you can talk to a Learning Advisor who
can help you with developing a wide range of academic skills and strategies on
topics including academic writing, critical thinking, researching and maths. See: https://library.leeds.ac.uk/skills

# Feedback

Only your final report is assessed formally as part of your MSc grade. However we recommend that you make some notes each week on the topics
presented, which I am able to read and give feedback on.

You are encouraged to give each other feedback as you work together.
Please provide feedback to me on my teaching in the following ways:
- Formally, by completing a module evaluation at the end
- Informally, by talking to me in and after class. Please come and talk to me and let me know how I am doing and if there are things we
can improve about the course presentation as we go along.

As this is a
small class I am able to adjust the presentation to meet your personal
requirements to some extent. I want you to learn as much as possible and
enjoy the subject so if you have ideas, let me know.
